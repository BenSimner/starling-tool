# Project Starling 

Current work includes:

* A very rudimentary FParsec parser for something that looks like Views;
* A small bit of badly translated Z3 example code, mainly to show that
  Z3 works.

This will expand as we start working on this!

## Requirements

A F# 4.0 development environment (tested with monodevelop on Linux),
and NuGet.

NuGet should be able to restore the rest of the prerequisites.

## Licence

MIT; see `LICENSE`.
